## hackathon project ColorMask

### Project Introduction
#### Our project is called Color Mask. It is a generative art project that uses Bitcoin to store NFT files.

#### Our unique feature is that we store all of our generative art algorithms on the Bitcoin main chain, rather than the traditional IPFS. This ensures the security and permanence of our NFT files.

#### We use the recursive inscription feature of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol. We upload all our algorithms and rendering libraries to the Bitcoin main chain. Through Bitcoin's recursive feature, we can realize the generative algorithms for NFTs.
#### This means we can entirely implement the generation of NFT algorithms and the creation of NFT art pieces on-chain.

### About Art

#### ColorMask is an Art NFT collection based on the Bitcoin Ordinals Protocol. Through the utilization of recursive ordinals and the HTML file format, we've significantly compressed the size of the inscription file, thereby reducing minting costs while ensuring high-definition resolution. Each NFT work is randomly generated, offering you the ability to choose and create the one that resonates with you.
